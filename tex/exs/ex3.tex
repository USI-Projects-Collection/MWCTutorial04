\section{Exercise 3 â€“ Step Counter}

\subsection{Android STEP\_DETECTOR}

First of all I modified the variable \texttt{accSensor} in the \texttt{StepsFragment} class to be of type:\\ \texttt{Sensor.TYPE\_STEP\_DETECTOR}. I could have easly have defined another variable but I wanted to make sure that all the counts were updted thanks to this sensor and not the previsouly used\\ \texttt{Sensor.TYP\_LINEAR\_ACCELERATION}.
